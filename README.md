## Why I started this project:

This project/app is my first React tutorial. It was a pretty intense tutorial in which you learned a lot of technologies. I had fun doing it and the instructors were awesome and very good at explaining concepts.

They taught me also advanced concepts not only about React but also how a senior developer thinks and the reasons why they make certain decisions
